## 📖 The Origin Story

**Age:** 17  
**Bank Account:** $0  
**Assets:** $100 Google Play credits, Google Search, infinite hunger  
**Diet:** Instant ramen (when lucky)

They told me to get a job flipping burgers for $7.25/hour.

I told them I'd rather flip cards for $7,250/hour.

**Everyone thinks poker is gambling.**  
**Gambling is for people who don't understand math.**  
**I understand math.**

This repo is the exact system I used to go from starving teenager to professional poker player making $50K+/month — starting with nothing but game theory, discipline, and a refusal to stay broke.

### The Edge Equation

```
Your Edge = (Your Skill - Average Opponent Skill) × Volume

Translation:
- Find games with bad players (fish)
- Be significantly better than them
- Play a LOT of hands
- Math does the rest

## 💰 The Bankroll Journey

### The Sacred Rule: BANKROLL MANAGEMENT

> **"More poker players go broke from bad bankroll management than from bad play."**

This is the #1 reason players fail. Not skill. Not luck. **DISCIPLINE.**

## 🎯 The Strategy Framework

### Phase 1: Tight-Aggressive Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Play TIGHT. Bet AGGRESSIVE. It's that simple at micro stakes.**

#### Starting Hand Chart (6-max)

```
EARLY POSITION (UTG, UTG+1):
├── RAISE: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99
├── RAISE: AKs, AKo, AQs, AJs, KQs
└── FOLD: Everything else

MIDDLE POSITION (MP, HJ):
├── RAISE: All above +
├── RAISE: 88, 77, AQo, ATs, KJs, QJs, JTs
└── FOLD: Everything else

CUTOFF (CO):
├── RAISE: All above +
├── RAISE: 66, 55, A9s, A5s-A2s, KTs, QTs, T9s, 98s

├── RAISE: KJo, QJo, JTo
└── FOLD: Trash

BLINDS (SB, BB):
├── 3-BET or FOLD from SB (don't flat)
├── DEFEND BB wider vs late position raises

```

#### Bet Sizing Rules

```
PREFLOP:
├── Open raise: 2.5-3x BB
├── 3-bet: 3x their raise (IP) or 4x (OOP)
└── Add 1BB per limper

POSTFLOP:
├── C-bet: 33% pot (dry boards) to 66% pot (wet boards)  
├── Value bet: 50-75% pot
├── Bluff: Same as value (balanced)
└── River: 66-100% pot for value

NEVER min-bet. NEVER overbet without a reason.
```

### Phase 2: Exploitative Adjustments (Weeks 4-12)

**Once you understand the rules, learn when to break them.**

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### The HUD Stats That Matter

```
VPIP (Voluntarily Put $ In Pot):
├── < 15%: Nit (tight)
├── 15-25%: TAG (good)
├── 25-35%: LAG (loose-aggressive)
└── > 35%: Fish (target)

PFR (Pre-Flop Raise):
├── Should be close to VPIP
├── Big gap (VPIP - PFR > 10) = passive fish
└── Small gap = aggressive player

AF (Aggression Factor):
├── < 1: Passive (call-heavy)
├── 1-2: Slightly aggressive
├── 2-3: Aggressive (good)
└── > 3: Hyper-aggressive (maniac)

3-Bet %:
├── < 4%: Only 3-bets premiums
├── 4-7%: Standard
└── > 8%: Light 3-bettor (can 4-bet bluff)

Fold to C-Bet:
├── > 60%: C-bet relentlessly
└── < 40%: Check back more, value bet thinner
```

---

### Phase 3: GTO Integration (Months 3-6)

**Game Theory Optimal = Unexploitable baseline.**

#### The GTO Concept

```
GTO means playing in a way that CANNOT be exploited.

Example - Bluffing Rivers:
├── If you NEVER bluff: Opponents fold to all your bets = you lose value
├── If you ALWAYS bluff: Opponents call everything = you lose money
├── GTO solution: Bluff at mathematically correct frequency
└── Result: Opponent can't exploit you regardless of their strategy

For rivers with pot-sized bets:
├── You risk $100 to win $100
├── Opponent needs 33% equity to call profitably
├── Therefore: Bluff 33% of the time, value bet 67%
└── This ratio makes opponent indifferent = unexploitable
```

#### GTO Study Tools

```
FREE:
├── PokerStrategy.com (articles, videos)
├── YouTube (find winning players' content)
├── Twitch (watch pros play and explain)
└── 2+2 Forums (strategy discussions)

```

### The Variance Reality Check

```
TRUTH: You can play PERFECTLY and still lose for WEEKS.

This is called VARIANCE. It's not bad luck. It's math.

Example at 5bb/100 win rate (very good):
├── You WILL have 100,000 hand breakeven stretches
├── You WILL have -20 buy-in downswings  
├── You WILL question everything
└── This is NORMAL

The only thing you control: YOUR DECISIONS
The rest: Math will even out over large samples

Required sample for accurate win rate:
├── Minimum: 50,000 hands
├── Reliable: 100,000 hands
├── Certain: 500,000+ hands

Until then: TRUST THE PROCESS

## ⚠️ The Warnings

### Poker Will Test You

```
EXPECT:
├── 6-month periods of break-even/losing (variance)
├── Questioning if you're actually good
├── Friends/family saying "just get a job"
├── Loneliness (grinding is solitary)
├── Health issues if you neglect yourself

SURVIVE BY:
├── Having bankroll to weather storms
├── Studying to KNOW you're a winning player
├── Finding poker community/friends
├── Maintaining exercise, sleep, nutrition
├── Remembering WHY you started
```

### This is NOT Get Rich Quick

```
REALITY CHECK:
├── 85% of poker players are LOSERS
├── Only top 5-10% make consistent profit
├── It takes 6-12 months to become profitable
├── You WILL lose money at first (tuition)
├── Discipline separates winners from losers

BUT:
├── The edge is LEARNABLE
├── Study + volume + discipline = profit
├── Unlike a job, your ceiling is unlimited
├── Unlike gambling, skill determines outcome
├── The matrix has no answer for +EV
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash

This framework is free.

Use it. Study it. Beat the fish. Escape the matrix.

Just remember: **The game is skill-based, but only if you treat it that way.**

Gamble with money you can't afford to lose, and the matrix wins.  
Play with discipline, study with purpose, and freedom is inevitable.
