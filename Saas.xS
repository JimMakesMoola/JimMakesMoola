## 📖 The Origin Story

**Age:** 17  
**Bank Account:** $0  
**Coding Experience:** Copy-pasting from Stack Overflow  
**Diet:** Instant ramen (the cheap kind, not the good kind)  
**Assets:** $100 Google Play credits, Google Search, and unlimited audacity

They told me:
- *"You need to learn to code first"* (takes years)
- *"You need funding"* (I can't even fund lunch)
- *"You need a team"* (I have no friends)
- *"You need an MBA"* (lmao)

I had none of that.

**What I had:**
- Problems I wanted solved
- The ability to describe those problems to AI
- Zero fear of shipping garbage
- Nothing to lose

**12 months later:** $127,000/month in recurring revenue across 4 micro-SaaS products.

This repo is the exact playbook. No VC funding. No technical co-founder. No code bootcamp.

**Just vibes, AI, and relentless shipping.**

### Why Micro-SaaS?

```
MICRO-SAAS vs. TRADITIONAL STARTUP:

Traditional Startup:
├── Goal: Billion dollar unicorn
├── Funding: Required (VCs own you)
├── Team: 10-100+ people
├── Timeline: 7-10 years to exit
├── Success rate: <1%
├── Your equity: Diluted to nothing
└── Stress level: MAXIMUM

Micro-SaaS:
├── Goal: $10K-$500K MRR (life-changing)
├── Funding: $0 (you own 100%)
├── Team: Just you (maybe 1-2 contractors)
├── Timeline: Months to profit
├── Success rate: 10-20% per product
├── Your equity: 100% forever
└── Stress level: Manageable

"I don't want to change the world.
I want to change MY world.
$50K/month does that."
```

### The 24-Hour Validation Test

```
BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE:

Hour 1-4: Problem Research
├── Can you find 10 people complaining about this problem?
├── Are they complaining in the last 6 months? (Still relevant)
├── Are they in communities you can reach?
└── Would YOU pay to solve this?

Hour 5-8: Competition Analysis
├── What solutions exist already?
├── Why do they suck? (Your angle)
├── What do they charge? (Your pricing)
├── Can you be 10x better at ONE thing?

Hour 9-16: Fake Door Test
├── Build landing page (2-4 hours)
├── Describe the solution
├── Add "Join Waitlist" button
├── Post in 3-5 relevant communities

Hour 17-24: Measure Response
├── How many waitlist signups?
├── Did anyone email asking for it?
├── Did anyone offer to pay early?
├── What questions did people ask?

VALIDATION SCORECARD:
├── 0-10 signups: Idea is weak, pivot
├── 10-50 signups: Promising, investigate more
├── 50-100 signups: Strong signal, build MVP
├── 100+ signups: STOP EVERYTHING AND BUILD
├── Pre-orders/payments: YOU HAVE GOLD
```

### The Idea Filter

```
EVERY IDEA MUST PASS:

□ PROBLEM: Is this a hair-on-fire problem?
           └── People actively searching for solutions
           └── Willing to pay real money
           └── Recurring need (not one-time)

□ MARKET: Is the market right?
           └── Big enough ($10M+ TAM)
           └── Small enough (no Goliaths)
           └── Growing (not dying)

□ SOLUTION: Can I build this?
           └── MVP possible in 1-2 weekends
           └── No deep tech required
           └── AI can help with 80%+ of code

□ DISTRIBUTION: Can I reach customers?
           └── I know where they hang out
           └── I can create content for them
           └── SEO potential exists

□ ECONOMICS: Does the math work?
           └── Can charge $20+/month
           └── >80% gross margins
           └── Low support burden

SCORE 5/5: BUILD IMMEDIATELY
SCORE 4/5: BUILD WITH CAUTION
SCORE 3/5: PROBABLY SKIP
SCORE <3:  DEFINITE SKIP
```

## ⚡ The Build System

### The Weekend MVP Framework

```
FRIDAY EVENING (4 hours): Foundation
├── Hour 1: Set up repo + Cursor/Claude
├── Hour 2: Database schema + Auth
├── Hour 3: Core data models
├── Hour 4: Basic API routes
└── Sleep. Seriously.

SATURDAY (8 hours): Core Feature
├── Hours 1-4: Build THE feature
│   └── Not features. ONE feature.
│   └── The thing that solves the problem.
│   └── Nothing else matters yet.
├── Hours 5-6: Basic UI (ugly is fine)
├── Hours 7-8: Stripe integration
└── You now have a product.

SUNDAY (8 hours): Ship It
├── Hours 1-2: Landing page
├── Hours 3-4: Polish critical paths
├── Hours 5-6: Basic docs/onboarding
├── Hours 7-8: Deploy + announce
└── YOU ARE NOW A FOUNDER.

TOTAL: 20 hours to revenue-ready product

"If you can't build an MVP in a weekend,
your scope is too big."
```

### The AI-Assisted Development Flow

```
HOW I BUILD WITH AI:

Step 1: Describe the Feature
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "I need a dashboard that shows:                    │
│  - Total revenue this month                        │
│  - Chart of revenue over time                      │
│  - List of recent transactions                     │
│  - All data from Stripe webhook events            │
│  Use Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Supabase" │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Get Initial Code
├── AI generates 80% working code
├── Copy into project
├── Run it (it will have errors)

Step 3: Debug with AI
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "I got this error: [paste error]                   │
│  Here's my current code: [paste code]              │
│  Here's my database schema: [paste schema]"        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 4: Iterate
├── AI fixes 90% of issues
├── Remaining 10%: More specific prompts
├── Stack Overflow for edge cases
└── Ship when "good enough"

PROMPTING TIPS:
├── Be SPECIFIC about your stack
├── Include relevant context (schemas, types)
├── Ask for explanations, not just code
├── Request error handling included
├── Specify the UI framework explicitly
└── "Make it production-ready" actually helps
```

## 💵 The Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Psychology

```
PRICING RULES:

1. CHARGE MORE THAN YOU THINK
   ├── Your first instinct is too low
   ├── If no one complains, you're too cheap
   └── You can always lower, hard to raise

### The MRR Growth Levers

```
MRR GROWTH = New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR

LEVER 1: INCREASE NEW MRR
├── More traffic (content, SEO, communities)
├── Better conversion (landing page, onboarding)
├── Higher prices (if value supports)
└── New channels (partnerships, affiliates)

LEVER 2: INCREASE EXPANSION MRR
├── Usage-based pricing tiers
├── Add-on features for power users
├── Team/seat-based pricing
├── Annual upsells to existing customers

LEVER 3: DECREASE CHURN
├── Better onboarding (time to value)
├── Regular feature updates (show momentum)
├── Proactive support (don't wait for complaints)
├── Build habits (daily/weekly use cases)
├── Annual plans (longer commitment)

THE COMPOUND EFFECT:
├── Month 1: $1,000 MRR (starting)
├── Add 20% new, 5% expansion, lose 5% churn
├── Month 2: $1,200 MRR
├── Month 6: $2,488 MRR
├── Month 12: $6,191 MRR
├── Month 24: $38,337 MRR
└── This is why SaaS is powerful

## 🧘 The Mindset

### The Builder's Psychology

```
TRUTHS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY:

1. SHIP UGLY
   ├── Perfect is the enemy of shipped
   ├── Users care about solutions, not pixels
   ├── You'll rewrite it all anyway
   └── Revenue validates, not features

2. KILL FAST
   ├── Most ideas fail (this is normal)
   ├── Quick kills = less wasted time
   ├── No emotional attachment to code
   └── The market decides, not you

3. CHARGE EARLY
   ├── Free users give bad feedback
   ├── Paying users tell you what matters
   ├── Revenue is the only validation
   └── $1 > 1000 signups

4. STAY SMALL
   ├── Solo/small team = speed advantage
   ├── No meetings, no politics
   ├── Pivot in a day, not a quarter
   └── $50K MRR solo > $500K with 20 people

5. COMPOUND EVERYTHING
   ├── Skills compound (you get faster)
   ├── Revenue compounds (MRR grows)
   ├── Reputation compounds (distribution)
   └── Play long-term games
```

### Surviving the Dips

```
THE EMOTIONAL JOURNEY:

Week 1: "I'm going to be rich!"
Week 2: "This is harder than I thought"
Week 4: "Maybe I should quit"
Week 6: "First sale! I'm a genius!"
Week 8: "Only one sale... I'm an idiot"
Week 12: "Wait, something's working"
Week 16: "I think I figured it out"
Week 24: "Holy shit, this is real money"

WHEN YOU WANT TO QUIT:

Remember:
├── Every successful founder wanted to quit
├── The dip is where most people stop
├── Pushing through the dip = your moat
├── You're learning even when failing
└── One product working = changes everything

Action steps:
├── Take a break (1-2 days, not weeks)
├── Review what you've learned
├── Talk to actual users
├── Simplify scope dramatically
└── Ship something tiny to feel progress
```

## 📊 The Metrics That Matter

### The SaaS Dashboard

```
TRACK WEEKLY:

Revenue Metrics:
├── MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
├── New MRR (from new customers)
├── Expansion MRR (upgrades)
├── Churned MRR (cancellations)
└── Net MRR Growth (should be positive)

Customer Metrics:
├── New signups
├── Trial → Paid conversion rate
├── Active users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
├── Churn rate (% customers leaving)
└── NPS or satisfaction score

Growth Metrics:
├── Traffic (and sources)
├── Signup rate (visitors → signups)
├── Activation rate (signup → active)
├── Referrals (organic growth)
└── CAC payback period

HEALTHY BENCHMARKS:
├── Monthly churn: <5% (ideally <3%)
├── Trial conversion: >10%
├── NPS: >30
├── Net MRR growth: >10%/month
└── LTV:CAC ratio: >3:1
```

### When to Kill vs. Scale

```
KILL THE PRODUCT WHEN:

├── 0 paying customers after 3 months of trying
├── Churn > 10% monthly (people don't want it)
├── You dread working on it
├── Market is clearly dying
├── Competition made you irrelevant
└── Unit economics are impossible

SCALE THE PRODUCT WHEN:

├── Consistent organic growth
├── Customers referring others
├── Churn < 5% monthly
├── Clear path to feature expansion
├── You're excited to work on it
├── Unit economics are positive
└── Users asking for more

"The goal is to fail fast and scale slow.
Most people do the opposite."
```

## 📜 License

This framework is open source. Use it. Copy it. Build on it.

The only thing I ask: **Actually ship something.**

Don't just read this and go back to your 9-5.

Pick a problem. Build a solution. Charge money.

**The matrix has no defense against people who ship.**
