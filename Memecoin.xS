## 📖 The Degen Origin

**Age:** 17  
**Bank Account:** $0  
**Diet:** Ramen dust and copium  
**Assets:** $100 Google Play credits, a cracked phone, and unmedicated ADHD

The matrix wanted me to study for the SATs.

I studied tokenomics instead.

Everyone said crypto was dead. Bear market. "Touch grass."

But I saw something they didn't:

**While VCs sleep, degens eat.**

This repo documents exactly how I turned $100 into $847,000 trading memecoins — including every rug pull, every 100x, and every sleepless night staring at candlesticks.

**This is not financial advice. This is financial warfare.**

## 🧠 The Degen Philosophy

### Why Memecoins?

```
TRADITIONAL MARKETS:
├── Insider trading = illegal
├── Information = paywalled
├── Speed = microseconds (HFT bots win)
├── Entry = $25K minimum for day trading
├── Edge = near zero for retail
└── Result: Matrix keeps your money

MEMECOIN MARKETS:
├── "Insider" trading = just being online
├── Information = free (Twitter, Telegram, Discord)
├── Speed = whoever copies contract first
├── Entry = $10 minimum
├── Edge = attention + speed + psychology
└── Result: Degens eat, normies sleep

The game is rigged.
But in crypto, WE rig it.
```

### The Memecoin Truth

```
WHAT NORMIES THINK:
"This has no value, it's just a picture of a dog"

WHAT DEGENS KNOW:
- Value is a social construct
- Attention is the scarcest resource
- Memes are the language of the internet
- Liquidity + narrative = price action
- Everything is a ponzi (including USD)
- First in, first out = profit
- "Fundamentals" don't exist here
- Only vibes, timing, and exit liquidity

"We're all exit liquidity for someone.
The skill is not being LAST."
```

```

### Tier 2: Token Evaluation

**The 60-Second Checklist (Before You Ape)**

```
SAFETY CHECKS (Non-negotiable):
□ Contract renounced? (Check on scanner)
□ Liquidity locked/burned? (Check LP tokens)
□ No mint function? (Can't print more tokens)
□ Honeypot check passed? (Use honeypot.is)
□ Top 10 wallets < 20% supply? (Concentration risk)
□ Dev wallet < 5%? (Dump risk)
□ Not a copy of rugged token? (Check name variations)

If ANY safety check fails → SKIP. There's always another play.

OPPORTUNITY CHECKS (Want most of these):
□ Market cap < $100K? (Early enough for big multiple)
□ Liquidity > $10K? (Can actually exit)
□ Holders growing? (Real interest)
□ Social presence? (Twitter, Telegram exists)
□ Narrative fit? (Matches current meta)
□ Meme quality? (Actually funny/viral potential)
□ Dev active? (Responding, building)
□ Chart healthy? (Not just straight down after launch)

SCORE:
├── 7-8 checks: STRONG APE
├── 5-6 checks: Small position
├── 3-4 checks: Watch only
└── <3 checks: SKIP
```

### Tier 3: Narrative Trading

**The Meta Cycle Framework**

```
MEMECOIN NARRATIVES CYCLE EVERY 2-8 WEEKS:

Example Cycle:
Week 1-2: Dog coins pump ($DOGE derivatives)
Week 3-4: Cat coins pump (counter-narrative)
Week 5-6: AI coins pump (tech narrative)
Week 7-8: Political coins pump (news events)
Week 9: Everything dumps, new cycle starts

HOW TO PLAY:
1. IDENTIFY emerging narrative early (< 3 coins pumping)
2. FIND lowest cap play in narrative (most upside)
3. RIDE the wave (don't marry your bags)
4. EXIT when narrative hits mainstream
5. ROTATE to next narrative

CURRENT META DETECTION:
├── What's trending on CT?
├── What are whales buying?
├── What keywords getting searched?
├── What's the current news cycle?
├── What meme formats are viral?
└── What did Elon just tweet?

"The narrative is the trade.
Tokens are just vehicles."
```

## ⚡ The Execution System

### Entry Strategy

```
POSITION SIZING (Golden Rules):
├── Never more than 5% of portfolio per trade
├── Scale in: 25% → 25% → 50% (as conviction grows)
├── Micro caps (<$50K): Max $200-500
├── Small caps ($50K-$500K): Max $1,000-$5,000
├── Mid caps ($500K-$5M): Max $5,000-$20,000
└── "Blue chips" (>$5M): Size based on conviction

ENTRY TIMING:
├── NEW PAIRS: First 5 minutes or wait for dip
├── PUMPING: Wait for consolidation, don't chase green
├── DUMPING: Catch the bounce (risky but profitable)
├── NARRATIVE PLAYS: Early in cycle only
└── NEVER: After CT influencer posts (you're late)

### The Profit Securing Protocol

```
EVERY TIME YOU 2X OR MORE:

1. Calculate profit
2. Send 20% of profit to stables (USDC/USDT)
3. Move stables to separate wallet
4. NEVER touch the stables wallet for trading
5. This is your "escape fund"

MILESTONE SECURING:
├── Hit $10K portfolio → Secure $2K in stables
├── Hit $50K portfolio → Secure $15K in stables
├── Hit $100K portfolio → Secure $40K in stables
├── Hit $500K portfolio → Secure $200K in stables
└── Beyond → You've escaped, play with house money

"Unrealized gains are unrealized.
Only stables in cold storage are real."
```

## 🧘 The Mental Game

### Surviving the Emotional Rollercoaster

```
THE DEGEN EMOTIONAL CYCLE:

  😎 "I found a gem"
     ↓
  🤑 "It's pumping, I'm a genius"
     ↓
  😰 "Why did I buy the top"
     ↓
  😭 "I'm never trading again"
     ↓
  🤔 "Hmm this new coin looks good..."
     ↓
  (Repeat forever)

MENTAL HEALTH RULES:
├── Set daily loss limit (stop trading if hit)
├── Touch grass at least once per day
├── Don't check portfolio every 5 minutes
├── Have non-crypto friends (they exist)
├── Sleep at least 6 hours (I know, hard)
├── Never trade angry or drunk
├── It's just money (you can make more)
└── The game never ends (don't burn out)
```

### The FOMO Cure

```
WHEN YOU MISS A 100X PLAY:

Remember:
├── There were 10,000 tokens that day
├── You couldn't have bought them all
├── The one you missed was visible in hindsight
├── Another 100x will come (they always do)
├── The people who caught it probably sold at 5x
└── FOMO buying = buying someone else's bags

MANTRA:
"I don't need THIS play.
I need A play.
There are infinite plays.
The next one is always coming."
```

### The Rug Recovery Protocol

```
WHEN YOU GET RUGGED:

Step 1: Acknowledge it happened
Step 2: Check what you missed (learn)
Step 3: Document in trading journal
Step 4: DO NOT revenge trade
Step 5: Take a break (minimum 1 hour)
Step 6: Remember: This is part of the game
Step 7: Return with smaller position sizes

STATISTICS:
├── Expected rug rate: 30-50% of plays
├── Expected total loss: Normal
├── One good play: Covers 10 rugs
└── Survival: The only metric that matters

"Getting rugged isn't failure.
Quitting after getting rugged is failure."
```

3. SLOW RUG
   └── Dev dumps slowly over time
   └── Defense: Watch dev wallet

8. BUNDLE LAUNCH

```

## 📜 Final Words

I started with $100 and ramen.

Now I have generational wealth secured and still degen with house money.

The path was:
- 342 rug pulls
- 847 sleepless nights  
- 2,847 tokens analyzed
- Infinite copium consumed
- 1 conviction: The matrix is escapable

This document is everything I wish someone gave me on Day 1.

**Use it. Adapt it. Survive.**

The market doesn't care about your story.  
But your story can end however you write it.

**WAGMI? Only if you make it so.**
